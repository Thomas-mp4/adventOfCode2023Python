# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 (Python) ðŸŽ„
This repository includes my Python code for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

The solutions in this repository are not the most optimal. My goal is to become more experienced with python, while simultaneously trying to maintain clear and concise code.
Above all, the challenge of completing the calendar is a fun endeavor!

# Structure
All solutions can be found in `solutions`, inputs for the puzzles are expected to be in an adjacent folder `inputs`, which will not be shared in this repository.

# Setup
Python 3.11
